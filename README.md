Adds OpenMage / PHP 8.2+ compatibility to Amasty's [Google Invisible reCaptcha](https://amasty.com/magento-google-captcha.html) extension for Magento 1.

Depends: 
Amasty_InvisibleCaptcha

Installation:
1. Copy the contents of the "step1" directory to the docroot
2. Copy the contents of the "step2" directory to the docroot

Caveats:

- This extension was written for OpenMage, not Magento 1
- I don't work for Amasty
