# Amasty Improved Sorting for OpenMage / PHP 8

Adds OpenMage / PHP 8.2+ compatibility to Amasty's [Improved Sorting](https://amasty.com/improved-sorting.html) extension for Magento 1.

Depends: 
Amasty_Sorting

Installation:
1. Copy the contents of the "step1" directory to the docroot
2. Copy the contents of the "step2" directory to the docroot
3. Clear cache and reload

Caveats:
- You must already own the Improved Sorting extension for Magento 1
- This extension was written for OpenMage, not Magento 1
- I don't work for Amasty
